# FBI_Uniform_Crime_Reporting_Analysis_2012

This project analyzes the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) data for the year 2012, sourced from law enforcement agencies submitting 12 months of NIBRS data to the FBI UCR Program. The data underwent conversion and publication in the Crime in the United States (CIUS), 2012. The project involves an end-to-end data pipeline, starting from Google Cloud Storage, to Python for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning model building. The insights derived from the analysis are presented through interactive visualizations on a Tableau dashboard connected to Google BigQuery.

### Usage
1. Set up Google Cloud Storage credentials.
2. Execute the data pipeline script to fetch data from Google Cloud Storage to Python.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook for data cleaning, EDA, and model building.
4. Connect Tableau to Google BigQuery to access and visualize the data.
